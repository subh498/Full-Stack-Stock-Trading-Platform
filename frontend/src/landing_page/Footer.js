            issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and sign the
            IPO application form to authorize your bank to make payment in case
            of allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain in your
            bank account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have not
            authorized anyone to trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone
